## Setup

1. Place the Horse Chopper in an area with at least a 7x7 clear space around it
2. Lead a horse (or other valid creature) with a lead
3. Right-click the chopper while holding the lead to attach the creature
4. The creature will automatically walk in circles, powering the chopper

## Checking the Working Area

**Shift+Right-click** the chopper with an empty hand to visualize the required working area:
- **Green blocks**: Clear - the area is suitable for the horse to walk
- **Red blocks**: Obstructed - remove these blocks for the chopper to function

## Usage

1. Right-click with logs or other choppable items to insert them
2. The attached creature will chop items automatically
3. Right-click to extract output items

## Recipe

## Notes

- The chopper is two blocks tall
- Unlike the manual Chopping Block, no axe is required
- The creature requires a clear path around the chopper
- Right-click with an empty hand to release the attached creature

## Automation

The Horse Chopper can be automated with hoppers:
- Insert items from the top or sides
- Extract output items from the bottom

This makes it ideal for automated wood processing farms.
